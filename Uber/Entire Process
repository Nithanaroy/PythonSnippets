HR Contact: Michelle Chen. She is a sweet lady, newly joined at Uber. Left Google as she couldn't find the freedom to implement her ideas.

Chandana first contacted me and took my details. One phone screen and then onsite. Applied for front end engineer role

Tip: Thoroughly was tested on Async programming in JavaScript.

Phone Screen:
Animating Progress Bar: Interviwer broke the question into pieces. 
1) A simple progress bar which fills some % at regular intervals. 
2) Progress should start on load
3) Add new progress bars on button click and should start immediately on load
4) Only 3 should animate at a time. If 5 are added in quick succession, only 3 should animate, once one of them finishes, 4th one starts. Similarly for the 5th.
Was tested on how I will pass messages between async functions (among progress bars).
